# Opening statement

Various reasons cause restaurants to throw away dishes every day even though the food may be totally fine. This doesn't land to the people who are starving for enough food. 
We designed a web application for restaurants and NGOs to connect and work together to prevent food waste, acting as a third-party transportation and storage system (which are sponsored by companies or organizations) of leftover foods being picked up from restaurants and partnering up with NGOs to distribute to them.

# Problem statement

Excess ingredients, canceled orders, and ordering more than needed cause food to be wasted every day in restaurants. Transporting and making food into dishes takes a lot of effort, care, and money. Many NGOs work hard to gather food to donate to peoples. Serving the leftover food to hungry stomachs is essential to conserve food wastage.

# Your Idea

Helping the restaurants to be able to donate food that originally was gonna be thrown away from our website. Which can then be transported to cold storages or NGOs by the transportation cost sponsored by companies and then NGOs can distribute it to needy people. By which we not only reduce food waste but also help alleviate hunger.

# How we got here

By framing the challenge, we identified the issues and decided to focus on not big companies but restaurants. In the ideation stage, we brainstormed about how to solve the problem. After the prioritization activity, we decided that a website would be the best solution.
